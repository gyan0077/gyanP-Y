                    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">C++ is a middle-level programming
                        language
                        developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell
                        Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of
                        UNIX.
                        This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for
                        beginners to advanded software engineers.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">C++ is a MUST
                            for
                            students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down
                            some of
                            the key advantages of learning C++:
                            C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you
                            lot of
                            control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software
                            development.
                            C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will
                            understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables
                            and
                            virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.
                            C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software
                            developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more
                            importantly you will get highly paid for your work.
                            C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So
                            you
                            can choose your area of interest of software development.
                            C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data
                            types,
                            storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.</span></p>

                    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Structured Query Language or SQL is a
                        standard database language that is used to create, maintain,
                        destroy, update and retrieve the data from relational databases like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server,
                        PostgreSQL, etc.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> <br> Creating Database: This concept
                            will make
                            you learn how to create your own database. <br>
                            Creating Tables and adding data: From this concept, you will learn how to create tables
                            inside
                            the database and insert data into them. <br>
                            SELECT Clause: Retrieve or fetch data from a database. <br>
                            FROM Clause: From which table in the database do you have to select data? <br>
                            WHERE Clause: It forms the condition based on which data have to be queried. <br>
                            DELETE Statement: For deletion tasks. <br>
                            INSERT INTO: For insertion tasks. <br>
                            AND and OR operator: Selecting data based on AND or operator. <br>
                            Drop and Truncate: It will drop or truncate the collection as per the condition. <br>
                            NOT Operator: It will select the data which is not based on the given condition. <br> WITH
                            Clause:
                            Understanding the concept of with clause and using it to give the sub-query block a name.
                            <br>
                            FETCH Clause: It will fetch the filtered data based upon certain conditions like fetching
                            only
                            the top 3 rows. <br>
                            Arithmetic Operators: Using arithmetic operators to filter the data conveniently and
                            precisely. <br>
                            Wildcard Operators: To intelligently select the exact data like names starting or ending
                            with T. <br>

                            CASE Statement: It will check for the conditionals and will query the data as per the
                            respective
                            case. <br>
                            EXISTS: It will form the nested query to filter out the data which exists in another
                            query. <br> DISTINCT Clause: It will select only the distinct data, not repetitive. <br>
                            Count Function: Returns the total count of the data filtered. <br>
                            Sum Function: Return the sum of all the data being queried. <br>
                            Average Function: Return the average of all the data being queried. <br>
                            Minimum Function: It will return the minimum data from the whole data that is being queried.
                            <br>
                            Maximum Function: It will return the maximum data from the whole data that is being queried.
                            <br>
                            ORDER BY: This statement will order the queried data as per your convenience in ascending or
                            descending order. <br>
                            GROUP BY: This statement will group all your queried data with the column given in the
                            condition. <br>
                            ALL and ANY Clause: They are logical operators in SQL and return boolean values as a result.
                            <br>
                            TOP Clause: Used to fetch the limited number of rows from a database. <br> Union Clause:
                            Just like the
                            mathematical union operator, this clause will make the union of the tables given. <br>
                            Intersection Clause: It will join the two or more tables where they are intersecting. <br>
                            Aliases: It will give an alias to the table which we can refer to later. <br>
                            Cartesian Join and Self Join: Sometimes to query out some data, we have to self join the
                            table
                            to itself. <br>
                            Inner, Left, Right and Full Joins: These four types of joining comes into play when we have
                            to
                            join one table with another. Look upon their syntax and learn to deal with these joins. <br>
                            Division Clause: Division is typically required when you want to find out entities that are
                            interacting with all entities of a set of different types of entities. <br>
                            Using Clause: If several columns have the same names but the datatypes do not match, the
                            NATURAL
                            JOIN clause can be modified with the USING clause to specify the columns that should be used
                            for
                            an EQUIJOIN. <br>
                            Combining values: Combining aggregate and non-aggregate values in SQL using Joins and Over
                            clause. <br>
                            MINUS Operator: It is used as “except” which means it will join the two intersecting tables
                            and
                            will minus one table so that only the intersection and the other table are covered. <br>
                            Joining 3 or more tables: Although used very rarely but this will make you learn and
                            understand
                            how to join 3 or more tables and then carry out the querying operations.</span></p>

                    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">The word Algorithm means ” A set of rules
                        to
                        be followed in calculations or other problem-solving

                                src="ProgIcon/algo.jpg" alt="" style="height: 219px;padding: 56px"><br> Types of
                            Algorithms:
                            There are several types of algorithms available. Some important algorithms are: <br>
                            1. Brute Force Algorithm: It is the simplest approach for a problem. A brute force algorithm
                            is
                            the first approach that comes to finding when we see a problem. <br>
                            2. Recursive Algorithm: A recursive algorithm is based on recursion. In this case, a problem
                            is
                            broken into several sub-parts and called the same function again and again. <br>
                            3. Backtracking Algorithm: The backtracking algorithm basically builds the solution by
                            searching
                            among all possible solutions. Using this algorithm, we keep on building the solution
                            following
                            criteria. Whenever a solution fails we trace back to the failure point and build on the next
                            solution and continue this process till we find the solution or all possible solutions are
                            looked after. <br>
                            4. Searching Algorithm: Searching algorithms are the ones that are used for searching
                            elements
                            or groups of elements from a particular data structure. They can be of different types based
                            on
                            their approach or the data structure in which the element should be found. <br>
                            5. Sorting Algorithm: Sorting is arranging a group of data in a particular manner according
                            to
                            the requirement. The algorithms which help in performing this function are called sorting
                            algorithms. Generally sorting algorithms are used to sort groups of data in an increasing or
                            decreasing manner. <br>
                            6. Hashing Algorithm: Hashing algorithms work similarly to the searching algorithm. But they
                            contain an index with a key ID. In hashing, a key is assigned to specific data. <br>
                            7. Divide and Conquer Algorithm: This algorithm breaks a problem into sub-problems, solves a
                            single sub-problem and merges the solutions together to get the final solution. It consists
                            of
                            the following three steps: <br>
                            Divide <br>
                            Solve <br>
                            Combine <br>
                            8. Greedy Algorithm: In this type of algorithm the solution is built part by part. The
                            solution
                            of the next part is built based on the immediate benefit of the next part. The one solution
                            giving the most benefit will be chosen as the solution for the next part. <br>

                            9. Dynamic Programming Algorithm: This algorithm uses the concept of using the already found
                            solution to avoid repetitive calculation of the same part of the problem. It divides the
                            problem
                            into smaller overlapping subproblems and solves them. <br>
                            10. Randomized Algorithm: In the randomized algorithm we use a random number so it gives
                            immediate benefit. The random number helps in deciding the expected outcome. <br>
